### Technologies

### Core App Features:

1.	The app should support persistent storage of scratch pages - to this end users should be able to create, read, update, and delete scratch & win pages using the app.
2.	Using the editing UI users should be able to execute the following authoring functions: a) Populate and crop a media asset that will appear under the scratch surface for a given card.  b) Customize the title message on a scratch card c) customize the completion message on a scratch card
3.	From the inspect view the user should be able to launch a preview of the scratch card. 
4.	From the inspect view the user should be able to publish a scratch page as a live entity that can be accessed from a URL.  Users should be able to unpublish a scratch card. 

### Love to have Features:

1.	Users can assign multiple media assets to the scratch card and have one of those populate to the scratch card based on a randomization script.  On refresh, the page would populate the scratch card with a different prize image randomly.
2.	Users should be able to â€œinspect" a scratch page. From the inspect view users should able to place the page it into a WSYWIG editable state to support authoring and content customization. 

### Nice to have Features: 

1.	Users can populate the media in a scratch card through a native GIF search via a service like Giphy.
2.	Users can archive scratch pages.
3.	Users can monitor basic engagement stats for a scratch page - number of page hits, number of completed scratches, devices stats, etc.
